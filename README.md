## Our Solution!
Our solution is called the stockWHALE. It is a React app for now.

Our app consists of 4 different screens: we have the home screen, analytics screen, Competition screen and a Search screen.
It alsof features a navigation bar at the bottom and a menu bar at the top.

In the home screen the users can scroll through flashcards relating to their investment portfolio reports.

In the analytics screen users get an overview of how their investments are doing and can alter this screen to their liking.

In the competition screen users can find their friends and see where they are in the weekly rankings according to their gained revenue.

In the search screen we implemented an API from financialdata.net where users can gain information on real-life stocks in real-time!
